									Software is created by people and for people, who are heterogeneous in their beliefs, backgrounds, and preferences. In one sense, software engineering is a social activity performed by individuals working together in teams. Methodologies and tools to deal with communication, coordination, knowledge sharing, compensation, and reconciliation are crucial for successful engineering and usage of software. In the other sense, social software has become a dominant and pervasive computing paradigm, not just for consumers, but for software engineers as well. Engineering collaborative systems with social software support requires the scalable investigation and construction of systems for group requirements, social awareness, privacy, security, and trust.

								<p>
									Both the development of new methodologies for social software engineering and the social software systems themselves benefit from the incorporation of ideas from psychology, sociology, and organizational science. The goal of this workshop is to organize software engineering researchers and practitioners with knowledge of each of these fields into a collective new field of Social Software Engineering (SSE).

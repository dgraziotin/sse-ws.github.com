								<p>
									In this workshop, we will bring together researchers and practitioners who study and build socially-oriented tools to support collaboration and knowledge sharing in software engineering. We will also investigate the adaptability of software to the dynamic social contexts in which it could operate, and the involvement of clients and end-users in shaping software adaptation decisions at runtime. These social contexts include norms, culture, roles and responsibilities, stakeholder goals and inter-dependencies, end-user perception of the quality and appropriateness of each software behaviour, and others.
								</p>
								<p>
									This workshop is organized around a number of topics, which we divide into two categories:
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Software Engineering as a Social Activity
										<ul>
											<li>Leveraging social computing in the requirements engineering, design, development, testing, and maintenance stages of software development</li>
											<li>Radically-distributed software engineering, semi-anonymous collaboration, "borderless" development teams</li>
											<li>Exploiting, customizing and extending existing software engineering processes and paradigms to support the socialness of software engineering</li>
											<li>Analysing the use of social networks and media to connect users and incentivize behaviours in software development communities and organizations</li>
											<li>The "social" software engineer: redefining the software engineering risks, rewards, and opportunities</li>
											<li>Using ICT-mediated social media to teach software engineering and share knowledge between different stakeholders</li>
											<li>Research methods, models and empirical studies on the socialness of software engineering process</li>
											<li>Forward-looking scenarios and research agendas</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Engineering Social Adaptability
										<ul>
											<li>Systematic capturing and analysis of user and community feedback and making user and community involvement a first order concern in software runtime decisions and planning software evolution</li>
											<li>Engineering methods, tools, and frameworks for sociability features of software, such as inspiring trust and encouraging users to act as collaborators</li>
											<li>Engineering software to support social awareness and the ability to socially adapt to norms, culture and organizational structure in different production environments</li>
											<li>Exploring and employing approaches in sociology and psychology for the engineering of social adaptability of software</li>
											<li>Engineering social and participatory sensing to gather data from users on the move</li>
											<li>Architectures and CASE tools for runtime management of software sociability</li>
											<li>Recommendation systems for social adaptability</li>
											<li>Research methods, models and empirical studies regarding engineering the sociability and social adaptability of software</li>
											<li>Forward-looking scenarios and research agendas</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>Submission</h3>
								<p>
									We invite three kinds of submissions:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Full papers (6-8 pages) describing social software engineering challenges, needs, novel approaches, and frameworks. New approaches must be evaluated with users who did not help design the system. Empirical evaluation papers and industrial experience reports are also welcome.</li>
									<li>Short position papers (3-4 pages) describing a new idea or work in progress.</li>
									<li>Posters and demo papers (1-2 pages) summarizing a research project, tool, or technique.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									All papers must conform at time of submission to the <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">ESEC/FSE 2013 Format and Submission Guidelines</a>. All submissions must be in English. Submissions must be in PDF format. Submissions that do not comply with the foregoing instructions will be desk rejected without being reviewed. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Papers must be <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sse20130">submitted electronically through EasyChair</a>. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation and appropriate comparison to related work.

									The Workshop on Social Software Engineering (SSE) focuses on the socialness of software engineering and of developed software. On one hand, we consider social factors in software engineering activities, processes, and CASE tools to be useful to improve the quality of development processes and the software produced by them. Examples include the role of situational awareness and multi-cultural factors in collaborative software development. On the other hand, the dynamics of the social contexts in which software could operate (e.g., in a cloud environment) calls for engineering social adaptability as a production-time iterative activity. One example is to gather usersâ€™ feedback on software quality and use it to autonomously or semi-autonomously adapt the software. The SSE workshop brings together academic and industrial perspectives to provide models, methods, tools, and approaches to address these issues.

								<p>
									Software developers and engineers have always been social creatures. The new electronic communication and collaboration technologies of the last decades (email, bulletin boards, Usenet, IRC, the web) were most often first colonized by programmers and engineers. Now software engineers are busy inventing and simultaneously consuming a whole new generation of social software and collaboration tools. Understanding this new social software engineering ecosystem is becoming an ever more important topic for software engineering research and crucial for software engineering practice. In this workshop, we plan to bring together researchers and practitioners working on different aspects of collaboration and knowledge sharing in software engineering as well as engineering aspects of Social Software to discuss new results and future research challenges. 
								</p>
								<h3>Workshop Goals</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Charting the social software engineering landscape. Collecting an overview of the latest developments with regard to the social aspects of software engineering and the use of social techniques and technologies in software development.
									</li>
									<li>
										Assessing the impact on software engineering and engineers. Investigating how social software is influencing and impacting on software engineering practice and software engineers. What does it mean for the future of practice and practitioners?
									</li>
									<li>
										Leveraging social software engineering. Provide pointers on how organizations and individuals can develop and incorporate social software technologies and techniques into their products and processes.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Workshop Topics</h3>
								<p>
									Major topics addressed at the workshop include (but not limited to):
								</p>
								<h4>Social Aspects in Software Engineering</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Leveraging social software in the requirements, design, development, testing, and maintenance of software
									</li>
									<li>
										Radically distributed software engineering, semi-anonymous collaboration, the borderless development team and leveraging the crowd
									</li>
									<li>
										Exploiting and tailoring existing software engineering processes and paradigms to support social software engineering
									</li>
									<li>
										Analyzing the use of social software to connect users and incentivize behavior in software development communities and organizations
									</li>
									<li>
										The social software engineer: redefining the software engineer, risks, rewards, and opportunities
									</li>
									<li>
										Using social software to teach software engineering and teaching the social aspects of software engineering
									</li>
									<li>
										Research methods, models and empirical studies on the nature of social software engineering
									</li>
									<li>
										Futuristic scenarios and research agendas
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Engineering Aspects of Social Software</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Engineering methods, tools, and frameworks for social aspects of software such as users involvement, privacy, trust, and security
									</li>
									<li>
										Systematically capturing and analyzing user and community feedback, making user and community involvement a first order concern in software lifecycles
									</li>
									<li>
										Studying the design and integration of social features such as user voting, feedback, and rating into existing and green field software systems
									</li>
									<li>
										Using social software to understand, promote, and incentivize interaction and collaboration between developers, users, and other stakeholders
									</li>
									<li>
										Requirements engineering of social software systems and using social media to capture user requirements
									</li>
									<li>
										Novel social development paradigms such as user development, user innovation, democratic software and open platforms
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Formats and Guidelines</h3>
								<p>
									We invite three kinds of submissions:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Full papers (6&ndash;8 pages) describing social software engineering challenges, needs, novel approaches, and frameworks. New approaches must be evaluated with users who did not help design the system. Empirical evaluation papers and industrial experience reports are also welcome. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Short position papers (3&ndash;4 pages) describing a new idea or work in progress. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Posters and demo papers (1&ndash;2 pages) summarizing a research project, tool, or technique. 
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									All papers must conform to the IEEE Computer Society Formatting Guidelines and must not exceed the page limits mentioned above, including figures and references. All submissions must be in English. Papers must be submitted electronically, in PDF format. The submission site is hosted by EasyChair and can be accessed from the workshop website. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Each submission will be reviewed by three members from the international program committee. Papers will be evaluated based on their originality, relevance to the workshop, and their potential to induce discussion. The papers with the best reviews (on average) will be accepted to the workshop. 
								</p>
								<p>
									All accepted papers will distributed to the workshop participants. Long and short position papers will be invited to be included in a workshop proceedings to be added to the ACM and the IEEE CS Digital Libraries. 
								</p>
								<p>
									It is the desire of the organizers that discussion of research at the workshop does not preclude publication of closely related material at conferences or journals. Authors of accepted papers will be able to choose whether to include their papers in the workshop proceedings. 
								</p>

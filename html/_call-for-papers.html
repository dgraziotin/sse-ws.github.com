								<p>
									Software developers and engineers have always been social creatures, indeed the new electronic communication and collaboration technologies of the last several decades (email, bulletin boards, Usenet, IRC, the web) were most often first colonized by programmers and engineers. Now software engineers are busy inventing (and simultaneously consuming) a whole new generation of social software and collaboration tools. Understanding this new social software engineering ecosystem is becoming an ever more important topic for software engineering research and crucial for software engineering practice. In this workshop, we plan to bring together researchers and practitioners working on different aspects of collaboration and knowledge sharing in software engineering as well as the engineering of Social Software to discuss new results and future research challenges.

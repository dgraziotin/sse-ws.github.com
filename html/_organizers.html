									<strong>Raian Ali</strong> is a Senior Lecturer in Software Systems Engineering at the School of Design, Engineering and Computing at Bournemouth University, UK. He received his PhD in Software Engineering from Trento University, Italy. He worked as research fellow at Trento University and Lero – the Irish Software Engineering Research centre, University of Limerick, Ireland. His research area is on the engineering of adaptive systems with particular focus on the requirements engineering stage and the role of both users  and community feedback and, also, dynamic environment in shaping software adaptation, compliance and evolution. He reviews/reviewed for several journals in software engineering (JSS, REJ, IJAOSE, IAJIT, SQJO and ISSE) and is a PC member in a range of software engineering events (EMMSAD, SCA, DSPL, Requirements@runtime, SEAMS, RIGiM, SSE, CSMR, RESC, ME, BSI, SocialComNet and QUAMES). He worked in a number of medium and large scale Italian, Irish, UK and EU projects including MEnSA, Mansec, FastFix, Aniketos, and Tropos. Raian co-chaired SSE’11 which was co-located with ESEC/FSE’11, Szeged, Hungary. He is currently a holder of a European FP7 Marie Curie Grant on the Engineering of Socially-Adaptive Systems (the SOCIAD Project).

									<strong>Andrew Begel</strong> is a researcher in the VIBE group at Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA, USA. He received a Bachelor of Science from MIT in 1996, and a Master of Engineering degree, also from MIT, in 1997. In 2005, he earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley. At Microsoft, Andrew studies software engineers to understand how their communication, collaboration and coordination behaviors impact effectiveness in collocated and distributed development. He then builds software tools that incentivize problem-mitigating behaviors. Andrew's recent work has focused on the intersection of social computing and software engineering. He co-organized workshops on the topic at ICSE 2011, ICSE 2012, and CSCW 2012, and has recently guest-edited a special issue of IEEE Software. He has also organized several workshops on the human aspects of software engineering, most recently the User evaluation for Software Engineering Researchers workshop at ICSE 2012. Andrew currently serves on the steering committee for ICPC, and has served on the PC for many conferences.

									<strong>Walid Maalej</strong> is a Professor of Informatics at the University of Hamburg. Previously, he led a research group on Human and Context Factors in Software Engineering at the TU Munchen, where he also received his Ph.D. Walid received a degree in Technology Management from the CDTM, an institution of the Bavarian Elite Network. Walid’s current research interests include the recognition of developer intentions, context-aware recommendation systems for knowledge workers, and open innovation. Walid has published more than 30 peer-reviewed papers, and has supervised more than 20 theses on these topics. He chaired the Industrial Track of RE10 and co-organized the Recommendation Systems for Software Engineering workshop (@ICSE), the Social Software Engineering workshop series (@SE and @ESEC/FSE), the Managing Requirements Knowledge workshop series (@RE), and several Eclipse DemoCamps. Walid has served on the PCs of numerous conferences, including ICSE ’13, RE 11, RE12, and ESEC/FSE 2011.

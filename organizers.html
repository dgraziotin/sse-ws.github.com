									<strong>Walid Maalej</strong> is a professor of informatics at the university of Hamburg. Previously he has been leading a research group on human and context factors in software engineering at the TU München, where he also received his Ph.D. Walid also received a degree in Technology Management from the CDTM, an institution of the Bavarian Elite Network. Walid's current research interests include recognition of developers' intentions, context-aware recommendation systems for knowledge workers, as well as open innovation. Walid has more than 30 peer-reviewed papers and supervised more than 20 theses on these topics. He chaired the industrial track of RE’10, and co-organized several international events such as the Recommendation Systems for Software Engineering workshop (@ICSE), the Social Software Engineering workshop series (@SE and @ESEC/FSE), the Managing Requirements Knowledge workshop series (@RE), and several Eclipse DemoCamps. Walid served on the PCs of numerous conferences, including ICSE 2013, RE’ 11, RE’12, and ESEC/FSE 2011.

									<strong>Andrew Begel</strong> is a researcher in the VIBE group at Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA, USA. He received a Bachelor of Science from MIT in 1996, and a Master of Engineering degree, also from MIT, in 1997. In 2005, he earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley. At Microsoft, Andrew studies software engineers to understand how their communication, collaboration and coordination behaviors impact effectiveness in collocated and distributed development. He then builds software tools that incentivize problem-mitigating behaviors. Andrew's recent work has focused on the intersection of social computing and software engineering. He co-organized workshops on the topic at ICSE 2011, ICSE 2012, and CSCW 2012, and is currently guest editing a special issue of IEEE Software. He has also organized several workshops on the human aspects of software engineering, most recently the User evaluation for Software Engineering Researchers workshop at ICSE 2012. Andrew currently serves on the steering committee for ICPC, and has served on the PC for many conferences.

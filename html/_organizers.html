									<strong>Filippo Lanubile</strong> is an Associate Professor of computer science at the University of Bari, Italy. He has the National Scientific Qualification for the Full Professor position. He leads the Research Laboratory for Network-based Collaboration and the Collaborative Development Research Group. From 1995 to 1997, he was a research associate in the Experimental Software Engineering Group at the University of Maryland. He is a recipient of a NASA Group Achievement Award (1996), an IBM Eclipse Innovation Award (2006), an IBM Faculty Award (2008), and the Software Engineering Innovation Foundation Award from Microsoft Research (2011). His current research interests lie at the intersection of Software Engineering and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and are aiming at advancing research and practice in collaborative software development. Filippo Lanubile has been the General Chair of the 2013 edition of the IEEE International Conference on Global Software Engineeringe (ICGSE). In 2013 he also co-organized the CSCW workshop on Trust in Virtual Teams: Theory and Tools. Previously he was the Program Chair of the 2008 ICGSE edition, the Workshop Chair of the 2nd Int. Workshop on Social Software Engineering and Applications (SoSEA 2009), and the co-organizer of the 2003 and 2004 editions of the International Workshop on Global Software Development. Filippo Lanubile is a member of the Editorial Board of the Empirical Software Engineering journal (Springer).

									<strong>Raian Ali</strong> is a Senior Lecturer in Software Systems Engineering at the Faculty of Science and Technology at Bournemouth University, UK. He received his PhD in Software Engineering from Trento University, Italy and worked as research fellow at Trento University in Italy and Lero – the Irish Software Engineering Research centre, University of Limerick, in Ireland. Raian’s research focuses on the engineering of adaptive systems with particular focus on the requirements engineering stage and the role of both users’ feedback and dynamic environment in shaping adaptation decisions. Raian reviews/reviewed for a range of journals in software engineering (REJ, JSS, IST, IEEE IC, IJAOSE, and SQJO) and as a PC member in a wide range of events in the area such as SEAMS, CHASE, EMMSAD, SCA, KEOD, and DSPL. He worked in a number of Italian, Irish and EU projects (MEnSA, Mansec, FastFix, Aniketos, Tropos) which involved a wide network of academic and industrial partners. Raian co-chaired SSE’11, and SSE’13 co-located with ESEC/FSE’11 and ESEC/FSE’13, respectively. He is currently a holder of an European FP7 Marie Curie Grant on the Engineering of Socially-Adaptive Systems (the SOCIAD Project).
